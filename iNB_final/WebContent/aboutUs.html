Indian National Bank(iNB) is an Indian multinational, public sector banking and financial services company. 

It is a government-owned corporation with its headquarters in Mumbai, Maharashtra. 

As of 2014-15, it had assets of 20.480 trillion (US$300 billion) and more than 14,000 branches, including 191 foreign offices spread across 36 countries, making it the largest banking and financial services company in India by assets.

The company is ranked 232nd on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations as of 2016.

The bank traces its ancestry to British India, through the Imperial Bank of India, to the founding, in 1806, of the Bank of Calcutta, making it the oldest commercial bank in the Indian Subcontinent. 

Bank of Madras merged into the other two "presidency banks" in British India, Bank of Calcutta and Bank of Bombay, to form the Imperial Bank of India, which in turn became the iNB in 1955.[8] Government of India owned the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India's Central Bank) taking a 60% stake, and renamed it the iNB. 

In 2008, the government took over the stake held by the Reserve Bank of India.

The roots of the iNB lie in the first decade of the 19th century, when the Bank of Calcutta, later renamed the Bank of Bengal, was established on 2 June 1806. The Bank of Bengal was one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). 

All three Presidency banks were incorporated as joint stock companies and were the result of royal charters. These three banks received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when, with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government of India. 


The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the re-organised banking entity took as its name Imperial Bank of India. 

The Imperial Bank of India remained a joint stock company but without Government participation.
